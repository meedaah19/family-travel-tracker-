The **Family Travel Tracker** is a web application that allows family members to track the countries they’ve visited on an interactive world map. Each user can be assigned a unique color, and their visited countries are visually represented on the map using that color.

## 🌍 Features

- Add multiple family members with custom colors.
- Each user sees only the countries they’ve visited.
- Countries are highlighted dynamically on an SVG map.
- Prevents duplicate entries for the same user.
  Data is stored and retrive using PostgreSQL
